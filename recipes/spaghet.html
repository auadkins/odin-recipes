<h2>How about spooning a helping of Spaghet down your throat?</h2>
<h2>Fill that sauce into my gullet!</h2>

<p>For many of us, our childhoods memories are defined by Thursday night Spaghet.</p>
<p>We always knew it was there, lurking somewhere amongst the shrubbery, waiting to spook us...</p>
<p>with it's deliciousness.</p>
<p>Though scholars maintain that this recipe was lost decades ago, our team managed to recreate it</p>
<p>Follow along in your own kitchen as we bring Spaghet back to dinner this Thursday!</p>
<p>Just remember - <em>do not</em> serve this dish within 500 ft of an elementary school.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Third Grade reading level</li>
    <li>52 year old body</li>
    <li>Poorly implanted hair plugs</li>
    <li>Form fitting spandex turtleneck</li>
    <li>Enough Ragu to allow it to spill seductively from thin lips for at least 45 minutes</li>
    <li>Some noodles. Pretty sure it doesn't matter what kind. Just use the same ones you used for the lasagna</li>
    <li>Roughly 35 gallons of whole milk to boil the noodles in</li>
    <li>A bath tub. To boil the noodles in</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Put on a few extra layers of clothes to ward of wandering Spaghet hands</li>
    <li>Ensure that the children are at a babysitter's, preferably out of town. <strong>Do NOT tell Spaghet where they are</strong></li>
    <li>Dump the milk into the bathtub</li>
    <li>Dump the noodles into the bathtub</li>
    <li>Dump the Spaghet into the bathtub</li>
    <li>Allow Spaghet's natural sensuality to heat the tub until the noodles boil</li>
    <li>Let the noodles simmer for roughly two hours</li>
    <li>Use a pool skimmer to transfer the noodles to your plates</li>
    <li>Siphon the milk into a pitcher to serve dinner drinks</li>
    <li>See if there is any sauce leftover from the lasagna. If so, add a hearty drizzle to each plate. If none is leftover, repeat steps 1-7 from the lasagna recipe</li>
    <li>Consume the Spaghet (meal), ensuring that Spaghet (the man) is seated outside arm's reach</li>
</ol>
