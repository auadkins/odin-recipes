# odin-recipes
Part of The Odin Project. Making progress.
Ok, so the README works from the command line. Good.
I suppose in this project, I'll be focusing on putting into practice the html I've learned so far.
I'll start with the boilerplate, add a heading or two, throw in a couple of paragraphs with <strong> and <em> things for fun.
I'll probably link to another page and include some images. 
I'll commit to Git and push to Github.
I think that's all I know how to do at this point.
